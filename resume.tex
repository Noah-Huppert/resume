     % Red Hat
     % designed developed engineered
	\textbf{Red Hat} \hfill Westford, MA \\
	\textit{OpenShift Engineering Intern} \hfill May - August 2019 \\
	\begin{itemize}
       	\item Designed a serverless application marketplace for Kubernetes reducing the barrier to entry for serverless technology
		\item Developed a GitHub bot and pull request status check to ensure content submitted by users is formatted
               correctly, making it easier for users to contribute to the serverless marketplace
		\item Engineered a continuous delivery system for Kubernetes Knative applications, increasing the development
               team's speed empowering them to ship more features
	\end{itemize}
     
	% Cambrio
	\textbf{Cambrio} \hfill Remote \\
	\textit{Developer Operations Engineer} \hfill January 2019 - Present \\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Assembling a batch processing pipeline for containerized machine learning prediction jobs to evaluate the 
			performance of different models
		\item Integrating a service mesh into Kubernetes to increase observability and make deployments more reliable
			via canary roll outs
		\item Building a serverless system to run machine learning models on demand with Kubernetes allowing clients to not worry
			about operations and focus on writing models
	\end{itemize}

	% Amino Pay
	\textbf{Amino Payments} \hfill Philadelphia, PA \\
	\textit{Developer} \hfill April 2018 - August 2018 \\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Constructed a tool which automatically verified the integrity of daily database backups by provisioning
			Amazon Web Services resources and restoring the backup to a test database instance, ensuring that business 
			critical data was recoverable in the event of a primary database failure

		\item Evaluated multiple secret storage solutions to determine the product best suited for the team and
			integrated it into the current infrastructure enabling developers to quickly and securely edit 
			application secrets

		\item Architected a deployment process for Amazon Web Services Lambda functions using CloudFormation templates
			and a continuous integration platform which allowed developers to quickly and easily iterate and deploy 
			their new serverless code
